/**
 * A readers-writer mutex maintains a logical pair of locks, one for
 * read-only operations, that can be processed concurrently, and one
 * for write operations which guarantees an exclusive access so that
 * neither write or read operation can be processed in parallel.
 *
 * Similarly to [Mutex], this readers-writer mutex is  **non-reentrant**,
 * that is invoking [readLock] or [writeLock] even from the same thread or
 * coroutine that currently holds the corresponding lock still suspends the invoker.
 * At the same time, invoking [readLock] from the holder of the write lock
 * also suspends the invoker.
 *
 * The typical usage of [ReadWriteMutex] is wrapping each read invocation with
 * [ReadWriteMutex.withReadLock] and each write invocation with [ReadWriteMutex.withWriteLock]
 * correspondingly. These wrapper functions guarantee that the mutex is used
 * correctly and safely. However, one can use `lock` and `unlock` operations directly,
 * but there is a contract that `unlock` should be invoked only after a successful
 * corresponding `lock` invocation. Since this low-level API is potentially error-prone,
 * it is marked as [HazardousConcurrentApi] and requires the corresponding [OptIn] declaration.
 *
 * The advantage of using [ReadWriteMutex] comparing to plain [Mutex] is an
 * availability to parallelize read operations and, therefore, increasing the
 * level of concurrency. It is extremely useful for the workloads with dominating
 * read operations so that they can be executed in parallel and improve the
 * performance. However, depending on the updates frequence, the execution cost of
 * read and write operations, and the contention, it can be cheaper to use a plain [Mutex].
 * Therefore, it is highly recommended to measure the performance difference
 * to make a right choice.

/**
 * This readers-writer mutex maintains two atomic variables [R] and [W], and uses two
 * separate [SegmentQueueSynchronizer]-s for waiting readers and writers. The 64-bit
 * variable [R] maintains three mostly readers-related states atomically:
 * - `AWF` (active writer flag) bit that is `true` if there is a writer holding the write lock.
 * - `WWF` (waiting writer flag) bit that is `true` if there is a writer waiting for the write lock
 *                               and the lock is not acquired due to active readers.
 * - `AR` (active readers) 30-bit counter which represents the number of coroutines holding a read lock,
 * - `WR` (waiting readers) 30-bit counter which represents the number of coroutines waiting for a
 *                          read lock in the corresponding [SegmentQueueSynchronizer].
 * This way, when a reader comes for a lock, it atomically checks whether the `WF` flag is set and
 * either increments the `AR` counter and acquires a lock if it is not set, or increments the
 * `WR` counter and suspends otherwise. At the same time, when a reader releases the lock, it
 * it checks whether it is the last active reader and resumes the first  waiting writer if the `WF`
 * flag is set.
 *
 * Writers, on their side, use an additional [W] field which represents the number of waiting
 * writers as well as several internal flags:
 * - `WW` (waiting writers) 30-bit counter that represents the number of coroutines  waiting for
 *                          the write lock in the corresponding [SegmentQueueSynchronizer],
 * - `WLA` (the write lock is acquired) flag which is `true` when the write lock is acquired,
 *                                      and `WF` should be `true` as well in this case,
 * - `WLRP` (write lock release is in progress) flag which is `true` when the [releaseWrite]
 *                                              invocation is in progress. Note, that `WLA`
 *                                              should already be `false` in this case.
 * - `WRF` (writer is resumed) flag that can be set to `true` by [releaseRead] if there is a
 *                             concurrent [releaseWrite], so that `WLRP` is set to true. This
 *                             flag helps to manage the race when [releaseWrite] successfully
 *                             resumed waiting readers, has not re-set `WF` flag in [R] yet,
 *                             while there readers completed with [releaseRead] and the last
 *                             one observes the `WF` flag set to `true`, so that it should try
 *                             to resume the next waiting writer. However, it is better to tell
 *                             the concurrent [releaseWrite] to check whether there is a writer
 *                             and resume it.
