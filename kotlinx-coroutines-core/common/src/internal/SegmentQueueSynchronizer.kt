/**
 * [SegmentQueueSynchronizer] is an abstraction for implementing _fair_ synchronization
 * and communication primitives. It maintains a FIFO queue of waiting requests and is
 * provided with two main functions:
 * + [suspend] that stores the specified waiter into the queue, and
 * + [resume] that tries to retrieve and resume the first waiter with the specified value.
 *
 * One may consider this abstraction as an infinite array with two counters that reference the next cells
 * for enqueueing a continuation in [suspend] and for retrieving it in [resume]. To be short, when
 * [suspend] is invoked, it increments the corresponding counter via fast `Fetch-And-Add` and stores the
 * continuation into the cell. At the same time, [resume] increments its own counter and comes to the
 * corresponding cell.
 *
 * A typical implementation via [SegmentQueueSynchronizer] performs some synchronization at first,
 * (e.g., [Semaphore] modifies the number of available permits), and invokes [suspend] or [resume]
 * after that. Following this pattern, it is possible in a concurrent environment that [resume]
 * is executed before [suspend] (similarly to the race between `park` and `unpark` for threads),
 * so that [resume] comes to a cell in the empty state. This race can be solved with two [strategies][ResumeMode]:
 * [asynchronous][ASYNC] and [synchronous][SYNC]. In the [asynchronous][ASYNC] mode, [resume] puts
 * the value into the cell if it is still empty and finishes immediately; this way, the following [suspend] comes
 * to this cell and simply grabs the element without suspension. At the same time, in the [synchronous][SYNC] mode,
 * [resume] waits in a bounded spin-loop cycle until the put element is taken by a concurrent [suspend],
 * marking the cell as broken if it is not taken after the spin-loop is finished. In this case, both the current
 * [resume] and the [suspend] that comes to this broken cell fail and the corresponding operations on the data
 * structure are typically restarted from the beginning.
 *
 * Since [suspend] can store [CancellableContinuation]-s, it is possible for [resume] to fail if the
 * continuation is already cancelled. In this case, most of the algorithms retry the whole operation.
 * However, if there are many consecutive cancelled waiters, it seems more efficient to skip them
 * somehow. Thus, there are different [cancellation modes][cancellationMode] that can be used.
 * In the simple mode ([SIMPLE]), which is used by default, [resume] simply fails on cancelled waiters as
 * described above, while in smart modes ([SMART_SYNC] and [SMART_ASYNC]) [resume] skips cells in the
 * [cancelled][CANCELLED] state. However, if cancellation happens concurrently with [resume], it can be illegal
 * to simply skip the cell and resume the next waiter, e.g., if this cancelled waiter is the last one.
 * Thus, it is possible for [SegmentQueueSynchronizer] to refuse this [resume]. In order to support this logic,
 * users should implement  [onCancellation] function, which returns `true` if the cell can be
 * moved to the [cancelled][CANCELLED] state, or `false` if the [resume] that comes to this cell
 * should be refused. In the last case, [tryReturnRefusedValue] is invoked, so that the value
 * can be put back to the data structure. However, it is possible for [tryReturnRefusedValue] to
 * fail, and [returnValue] is called in this case. Typically, this [returnValue] function coincide
 * with the one that resumes waiters (e.g., [release][Semaphore.release] in [Semaphore]). The difference
 * between [SMART_SYNC] and [SMART_ASYNC] modes is that in the first one the [resume] that comes to the
 * cell with cancelled waiter waits in a spin-loop until the cell is marked either with [CANCELLED]
 * or [REFUSE] mark, while in [SMART_ASYNC] mode it replaces the cancelled waiter with the value of
 * the resumption and finishes, so that the cancellation handler completes this [resume] eventually.
 * This way, in [SMART_ASYNC] mode the value passed to [resume] can be out of the data structure for a while.
 *
 * Here is a state machine for cells. Note that only one [suspend]
 * and at most one [resume] operation can deal with each cell.
